#eark-ip-test-corpus

This repository is home to the E-ARK information package validation test corpus (hereafter called the test corpus).

## What is the test corpus?
The test corpus comprises a set of human readable and machine readable test cases. Each test case is described within a xml-file named testcase.xml and the testcase.xml defines a minimum of tests  to be executed to verify compliance with a specific requirement within the following specifications :
-	the Common Specification for Information Packages - hereafter called CSIP.
-	the E-ARK Specification for Submission Information Packages hereafter called SIP.
-	the E-ARK Specification for Dissemination Information Packages hereafter called DIP.
A testcase.xml links to valid and invalid E-ARK information packages which are also to be found in this repository.
For a more thorough description of the testcase.xml, see our wiki.

## Why do we have a test corpus?
The test corpus has served and continues to serve these main purposes:
1)	Every test case represents simple and implemented samples of E-ARK information packages that are either valid or invalid according to a requirement in a E-ARK specification. This way users of the E-ARK specifications can easily get hands and eyes on examples when trying to understand the specifications.
2)	The test corpus provides a set of test cases and information packages that can be used to test software validators for the E-ARK specifications.
3)	The development of the test corpus is an exploration of the testability of requirements â€“ the development of the test corpus therefore produces a lot of feedback to the authors and owners of the E-ARK specifications.
