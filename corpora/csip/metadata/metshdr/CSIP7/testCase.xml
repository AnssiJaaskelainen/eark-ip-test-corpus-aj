            <!-- Creating a static file that includes a date in the future is
              problematic, as the passage of time will at one point break
              it. The obvious solution is to put the date as far as possible,
              but this introduces potential errors from time processing bugs
              in different data structures and algorithms. Out of a variety of
              these (see
              https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_formatting_and_storage_bugs),
              as of 2020-12-12, the most relevant seems to be the Unix 2038
              problem (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2038_problem).
              The last correctly handled value is 2038-01-19T03:14:07, but
              to provide ample buffer for time zones, server clock
              discrepancies etc., it seems reasonable to set the date at
              2037-01-01. -->
