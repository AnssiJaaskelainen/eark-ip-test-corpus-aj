Testcase for structural requirement:

- [CSIPSTR5](https://dilcisboard.github.io/E-ARK-CSIP/specification/implementation/structure/#CSIPSTR5)
    IP root folder MUST include a folder named `metadata`;

Folder "invalid" contains invalid IPs that violate against requirement [CSIPSTR5](https://dilcisboard.github.io/E-ARK-CSIP/specification/implementation/structure/#CSIPSTR5)
