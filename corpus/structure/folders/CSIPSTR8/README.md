Testcase for structural requirement:

- [CSIPSTR8](https://dilcisboard.github.io/E-ARK-CSIP/specification/implementation/structure/#CSIPSTR8)
   If any other metadata are available, they CAN be included in separate sub-folders, for example an additional folder named other.

Folder "pass" contains valid IPs that check requirement [CSIPSTR8](https://dilcisboard.github.io/E-ARK-CSIP/specification/implementation/structure/#CSIPSTR8)
