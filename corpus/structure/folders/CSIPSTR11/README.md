Testcase for structural requirement:

- [CSIPSTR11](https://dilcisboard.github.io/E-ARK-CSIP/specification/implementation/structure/#CSIPSTR11)
  `Representation` folder MUST include a folder `data`.

Folder "fail" contains invalid IPs that violate against requirement [CSIPSTR11](https://dilcisboard.github.io/E-ARK-CSIP/specification/implementation/structure/#CSIPSTR11)

Folder "pass" contains valid IPs that check requirement [CSIPSTR11](https://dilcisboard.github.io/E-ARK-CSIP/specification/implementation/structure/#CSIPSTR11)
