Testcase for structural requirement:

- [CSIPSTR10](https://dilcisboard.github.io/E-ARK-CSIP/specification/implementation/structure/#CSIPSTR10)
  `Representations` folder MUST include a folder for each representation;

Folder "fail" contains invalid IPs that violate against requirement [CSIPSTR10](https://dilcisboard.github.io/E-ARK-CSIP/specification/implementation/structure/#CSIPSTR10)

Folder "pass contains valid IPs that check requirement [CSIPSTR10](https://dilcisboard.github.io/E-ARK-CSIP/specification/implementation/structure/#CSIPSTR10)
