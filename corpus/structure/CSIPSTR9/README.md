Testcase for structural requirement:

- [CSIPSTR9](https://dilcisboard.github.io/E-ARK-CSIP/specification/implementation/structure/#CSIPSTR9)
    IP root folder MUST include a folder named `representations`;

Folder "invalid" contains invalid IPs that violate against requirement [CSIPSTR9](https://dilcisboard.github.io/E-ARK-CSIP/specification/implementation/structure/#CSIPSTR9)
