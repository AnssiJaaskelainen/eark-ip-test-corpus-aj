mets/metsHdr/@CREATEDATE
mets/metsHdr/@CREATEDATE records the date and time the package was created.

  <description>
    mets/metsHdr/@CREATEDATE MUST exist is optional in the mets schema but mandatory in the CSIP7. A rule therefore has to be set up.
    mets/metsHdr/@CREATEDATE MUST have a value that is a date. The value in this attribute is parsed against the mets schema to type="xsd:dateTime". A rule is therefore not being set up.  
    mets/metsHdr/@CREATEDATE value MUST be the actual date the package was created. This is not testable.

            METS.xml file has mets/metsHdr/@CREATEDATE = "2037-01-01T12:00:00".
             Creating a static file that includes a date in the future is
              problematic, as the passage of time will at one point break
              it. The obvious solution is to put the date as far as possible,
              but this introduces potential errors from time processing bugs
              in different data structures and algorithms. Out of a variety of
              these (see
              https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_formatting_and_storage_bugs),
              as of 2020-12-12, the most relevant seems to be the Unix 2038
              problem (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2038_problem).
              The last correctly handled value is 2038-01-19T03:14:07, but
              to provide ample buffer for time zones, server clock
              discrepancies etc., it seems reasonable to set the date at
              2037-01-01.
